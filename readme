## Features

## Custom Carousel using Flatlist

This project includes a custom carousel component that is built using the Flatlist component. The carousel is designed to display a set of images or other content in a horizontally scrolling list.

## Permission Handling

This project includes permission handling for accessing the user's location. When the app is first launched, the user will be prompted to grant permission for the app to access their location. If the user declines, the app will not be able to use the live tracking feature.

## Custom Countdown Optimized Counter

This project includes a custom countdown optimized counter component that is designed to count down to a specific date or time. The counter is optimized to update efficiently and accurately, even when the app is in the background or the device is in a low-power mode.

## Notifications using Notifee Library

This project includes notifications that are implemented using the Notifee library. Notifications can be scheduled to appear at specific times, and can include custom content such as images, text, and links.

## Live Tracking and Location Picker

This project includes a live tracking feature that allows the user's location to be tracked in real-time. The app also includes a location picker component that allows the user to select a specific location on a map.
